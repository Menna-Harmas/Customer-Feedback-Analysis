Here\u2019s a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It\u2019s clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it\u2019s the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished.

Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away.

So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.": -0.01977813564251531, "reviewDescription_Got it for good price , best exchange value for my iPhone 11, properly packed, genuine product, best experience purchasing thank you Amazon.": -0.012757321835029171, "reviewDescription_Got it today, delivered 1 day earlier than promised (thank you!).

I decided to switch to IOS finally.First of all 128gb variant was out of stock, so had to buy the 256 gb variant. I have used it for few months, and i have mixed opinions. I will list the cons and pros:-Pros-1) Battery life is awesome. Easily goes a day without charging twice with good amount of social media usages.2) Really smooth UI experience. Feels like 90 fps.3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.5)No c type support6) Notification management is very poor.7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.So, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android.

I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be \"worn\" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.": 0.0413828622329734, "reviewDescription_I have made a mistake of going with the hype and buying the iPhone...It's a useless piece of trash for 50k.

No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.": 0.0, "reviewDescription_It is literally just a phone with an Apple logo on it.

I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one\u2019s that you\u2019re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I\u2019m still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It\u2019ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.Update:- i have been using this phone since March\u201923 so it\u2019s been 2 months now and I have found that this phone is starting to lag a little. Not much, just a little but it is annoying (having spent so much money you\u2019d expect more). Also, even with full network bars i sometimes struggle to get net connection.

The phone itself worked perfectly and came in at a nice 96% battery life so it\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s up there. The box and accessories were kinda cheap and not so great but I was upgrading from my old iPhone SE so I had spares around. Overall as of I'm writing this,this phone works perfectly fine and almost brand new, the price wasn\u2019t the best but it was certainly cheaper than a brand new one. The only gripes I have is the phone came in kind of full of smudges from a wipe and it was a pain to set up the eSIM but it\u2019s not too bad and just takes some effort.

The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it\u2019s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone\u2026 including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up\u2026.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don\u2019t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It\u2019s just a mode of charging for me and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I\u2019ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don\u2019t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don\u2019t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don\u2019t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I\u2019m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can\u2019t place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should\u2019ve been less.

I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn\u2019t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I\u2019m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don\u2019t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.": -0.0038927059445432494, "reviewDescription_My keys are not working": 0.03969587969732646, "reviewDescription_My phone is getting heated up .. couldn\u2019t understand the reason behind": 0.0, "reviewDescription_My phone screen got damaged by just applying little pressure.

My 4.5 year old iPhone 11 is still running well and was a great value for money in the sense that I used it for 4 years instead of 2 that I did my previous phones, it is still serving well, but this one DOES NOT GET AI FEATURES! I still can't digest this, that this is still the latest iphone you can buy in the market, it sells for more than flagship prices and comes with lesser features than competitors and Apple chose not to provide AI features with it making this absolutely unacceptable. Apparently Apple cheaped out on RAM in this and only provided 6 gb whereas AI requires minimum 8 gb of RAM and this is the reason even M1 laptops and tablets with weaker NPU than iPhone 15 get AI and this doesn't! It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!": 0.04981920792093571, "reviewDescription_So, I bought this because Androids are now the same price as iPhones.

Yes the battery, camera, and storage is way better. That much is true. But the build quality? It's hit and miss. Reception Is meh but that could be the SIM card. I've had budget android phones that get full LTE reception where my 13 will have one bar. But again that could just be my SIM card on it's way out. Something about certain aspects of the phone feel much cheaper than bits of it's predecessor. For example the rear glass. Yes it's supposedly the same ceramic shield from the 12 but I've found it scratches much easier for no real reason. Another example is the speaker grille in the front notch. It looks alot cheaper and sounds that way too than the one in the 12. Pretty tinny and just rattley sounding. It's not a horrible phone. It's the first iPhone I've felt like I can get android style utility from. But the questionable build quality changes over the previous generation just stifle it for no reason. That's not to say the phone is entirely built out of meh. For example the camera lenses and the bump are much bigger on the new 13. I work as a mechanic and subjected my old 12 to the same rigors. The 12 took it like a champ aside from very light camera lenses scratching. I've subjected the 13 to much more stress and it just shrugs it off aside from the seemingly unexplainable rear glass scratches. I haven't dropped it like my 12 yet so theres always that.

In the first place, users consider replacing their battery when it is around 80%, so no one wants to buy one with the same 80% battery. The lifespan of an iPhone is considered to be between 80% (0) and 100% (20) (within the range of 20). If it arrives at 80%, it cannot be said to be refurbished. Even when buying or reselling used iPhones, except for new ones, they have a maximum charge of 70-80%. Therefore, the way to distinguish between bad and good dealers is mostly determined by the scratches on the exterior and the battery capacity. Incidentally, the usage time at 70% is around 4 hours 70% to 100% (\u2193) time with maximum load 80% usage time is around 6 hours (maximum charging time generally recommended for replacing) 90% usage time is more than 9 hours 100% usage time is more than 11 hours [Those that do not last half a day are likely to cause stress] I was debating between the 13 and the 14, and I bought the 13, and it was the right decision. The price had come down quite a bit, so I thought there might be differences, but the performance was exactly the same. The only difference was whether the number of cores was one more or one less, and there was almost no difference in terms of operation. There are probably only darker and lighter color variations, but it doesn't seem like an upgrade. The operation is sluggish on both the 13 and 14, and it feels like scrolling (screen movement) doesn't slide.

Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1.

Problems include - Green screen, network issues, etc.4) Many people Iphones underwent Green Screen after the latest update and as their Iphone was not under warranty had to spend 400$ or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change. Meaning Apple company will release update, because of which the Iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it.5) Iphone - covers, tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design. Even after spending 1500 to 2000 INR for an Iphone cover, it will last only for 6-8 months. After that, either it will become dull, dirty or look ugly or pale. An android cover of 250 Rs also functions the same way.6) Apps - That is a total scam everyone knows that. You have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in App StoreMoral of the story -You can buy an expensive Iphone and use it comfortable for a year or maximum 2. So, if you are ready to spend so much money just for a year, it is the best mobile. For long run, this is just a scam that it will last for a long run.Joke of the year - You will be prompted with features that Iphone and Macbook's only have! - The only issue is, comman man never uses those features!

Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial.

Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click.

However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum.Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of \"no available agents, call back later\". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone. I know there is always a risk with refurb items, but I've rarely had issue and when I do they are resolved quickly.I purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 in August of last year and it was working great with no issues. It was a like new phone. However, in the last few days I've started getting \"Unknown Battery\" messages and my phone will turn off at random multiple times throughout the day, to the point where I don't feel confident making phone calls with the phone for fear of them being dropped.I went back to the order to see what my options were in terms of warranty and tech support, and it's EXTREMELY convoluted. It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as \"new\" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable. When I tried to chat with someone I found my message was sent over to Loop Mobile, who must be the third party company who actually refurbished the phone. But it's unclear who I need to contract to see how to get this fixed or if I just need to pay out of pocket. I haven't even had the phone a year, so it's a disappointing development for what has otherwise been a great phone.": 0.0, "reviewDescription_USB cable was defective, it was not charging": -0.012978378966677027, "reviewDescription_USB doesn\u2019t work": -0.016698508108065852, "reviewDescription_UTTER WASTE OF MONEY!!

It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo\u2019s beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1.

Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12\u2019s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn\u2019t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don\u2019t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic\u2019s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I\u2019m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I\u2019d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around \u2014 be it via USB-C or MagSafe \u2014 as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.": -0.012798008091313583, "reviewDescription_Week signal s": 0.0, "reviewDescription_Well, I must admit I was very surprised!
